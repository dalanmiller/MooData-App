MooData-App
===========

This is the front-end application for MooData which we will develop using Yeoman and deploy via PhoneGap


##Requirements
* Install Nodejs/NPM
* `npm install -g phonegap` to install PhoneGap
* `npm install -g yo` to install Yeoman
* On Linux/Mac need to install `sudo gem install compass` - not sure howw to do this on Windows yet. 

##Running a local server

Just run `grunt server` in the root of the repository and your default web browser will be opened with the app running with `app/index.html` as the root of your application.
